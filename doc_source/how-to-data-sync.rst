     - Use `AWS AppSync <https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/>`__ instead. AppSync is a new service for synchronizing application data across devices. Like Cognito Sync, AppSync enables synchronization of a user's own data, such as game state or app preferences. AppSync extends these capabilities by allowing multiple users to synchronize and collaborate in real-time on shared data, such as a virtual meeting space or chatroom.

       `Start building with AWS AppSync now <https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/>`__.

Existing Cognito Sync users can find documentation here:
