   The following content applies if you are already using the AWS Mobile Hub to configure your backend. If you are building a new mobile or web app, or you're adding cloud capabilities to your existing app, use the new `AWS Amplify CLI <http://aws-amplify.github.io/>`__ instead. With the new Amplify CLI, you can use all of the features described in `Announcing the AWS Amplify CLI toolchain <https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/announcing-the-aws-amplify-cli-toolchain/>`__, including AWS CloudFormation functionality that provides additional workflows.

The AWS Mobile SDKs for Android and iOS enable you to quickly and easily integrate robust cloud backends into your existing mobile apps.
