   The following content applies if you are already using the AWS Mobile Hub to configure your backend. If you are building a new mobile or web app, or you're adding cloud capabilities to your existing app, use the new `AWS Amplify CLI <http://aws-amplify.github.io/>`__ instead. With the new Amplify CLI, you can use all of the features described in `Announcing the AWS Amplify CLI toolchain <https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/announcing-the-aws-amplify-cli-toolchain/>`__, including AWS CloudFormation functionality that provides additional workflows.

|AMHlong| is a service that enables even a novice to easily deploy and configure mobile app backend
features using a range of powerful AWS services.

You create a free project, then choose and configure mobile app features using a point and click
console. |AMH| takes care of the complexities in the background and then supplies you with step by
step integration instructions.
