.. _add-aws-mobile-sdk-basic-setup-prerequisites:

Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment
===========================================

We strongly recommend that you use the Amplify CLI for building the serverless backend for your app. If you have already installed the CLI, skip ahead to :ref:`Step 2 <add-aws-mobile-sdk-basic-setup>`.

*  `Sign up for an AWS Account <https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup?redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fregistration-confirmation#/start>`__.

*  Install `Node.js <https://nodejs.org/>`__ and npm (if they are not already installed).

.. note::

   Verify that you are running at least Node.js version 8.x or greater and npm version 5.x or greater by running :code:`node -v` and :code:`npm -v` in a terminal/console window. Older versions aren't supported and might generate errors.

To install and configure the Amplify CLI globally, run the following commands in a terminal window.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli

   $ amplify configure

Minimum requirements for your development environment are as follows.

    .. container:: option

       Android - Java
           * Choose the Android Java app project you want to integrate with an AWS backend.

           * `Install Android Studio <https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html#downloads>`__ version 2.33 or higher.

           * Install Android SDK for API level 23 (Android SDK 6.0).

       Android - Kotlin
           * Choose the Android Kotlin app project you want to integrate with an AWS backend.

           * `Install Android Studio <https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html#downloads>`__ version 2.33 or higher.

           * Install Android SDK for API level 23 (Android SDK 6.0).

       iOS - Swift
          * Choose the iOS app project you want to integrate with an AWS backend.

          * `Install Xcode <https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/>`__ version 8.0 or later.

Step 2: Set Up Your Backend
===========================

#. The CLI prompts you for configuration parameters.

    .. container:: option

       Android - Java
           In a terminal window, navigate to your project folder (the folder that typically contains your project level :file:`build.gradle`), and add the SDK to your app.

          .. code-block:: none

              $ cd ./YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER
              $ amplify init

       Android - Kotlin
           In a terminal window, navigate to your project folder (the folder that typically contains your project level :file:`build.gradle`), and add the SDK to your app.

          .. code-block:: none

              $ cd ./YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER
              $ amplify init

       iOS - Swift
           In a terminal window, navigate to your project folder (the folder that typically contains your project level :file:`xcodeproj` file), and add the SDK to your app.

          .. code-block:: none

              $ cd ./YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER
              $ amplify init

#. To create your backend AWS resources and add a configuration file to your app, run the following:

   .. container:: option

       Android - Java
          .. code-block:: bash

            $ amplify push


       Android - Kotlin
          .. code-block:: none

            $ amplify push

       iOS - Swift
          .. code-block:: none

            $ amplify push

          In the Finder, navigate to the folder containing your app :file:`.xcodeproj` file. From there, drag :code:`awsconfiguration.json` to Xcode under the top Project Navigator folder (the folder name should match your Xcode project name). In the :guilabel:`Options` dialog box that appears, do the following:

          * Clear the :guilabel:`Copy items if needed` check box.

          * Choose :guilabel:`Create groups`, and then choose :guilabel:`Next`.

#. To verify that the CLI is set up for your app, run the following command. The CLI displays a status table with no resources listed. As you add categories to your app, backend resources created for your app are listed in this table.

   .. code-block:: none

      $ amplify status
      | Category | Resource name | Operation | Provider plugin |
      | -------- | ------------- | --------- | --------------- |

   Use the steps in the next section to configure the connection between your app and the serverless backend.

.. _add-aws-mobile-sdk-connect-to-your-backend:

Step 3: Connect to Your Backend
===============================

Perform the following steps to set up a connection to AWS services that you'll use in the Get Started section of this guide.

.. container:: option

   Android - Java
      #. Add dependencies to your :file:`app/build.gradle`, and then choose :guilabel:`Sync Now` on the upper-right side of Android Studio. These libraries enable basic AWS functions, like credentials and analytics.

         .. code-block:: java

             dependencies {
                 implementation 'com.amazonaws:aws-android-sdk-core:2.7.+'
             }

      #. Your :file:`AndroidManifest.xml` must contain the following:

         .. code-block:: xml

             <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
             <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>

      Your app is now ready for you to add cloud-powered features. We recommend :ref:`adding analytics <add-aws-mobile-analytics>` as your first feature.

   Android - Kotlin
      #. Add dependencies to your :file:`app/build.gradle`, and then choose :guilabel:`Sync Now` on the upper-right side of Android Studio. These libraries enable basic AWS functions, like credentials and analytics.

         .. code-block:: java

             dependencies {
                 implementation 'com.amazonaws:aws-android-sdk-core:2.7.+'
             }

      #. Your :file:`AndroidManifest.xml` must contain the following:

         .. code-block:: xml

             <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
             <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>

      Your app is now ready for you to add cloud-powered features. We recommend :ref:`adding analytics <add-aws-mobile-analytics>` as your first feature.

   iOS - Swift
      #. Install Cocoapods. From a terminal window run the following:

         .. code-block:: none

            sudo gem install cocoapods

      #. Create :file:`Podfile`. From a terminal window, navigate to the directory that contains your project's :file:`.xcodeproj` file and run the following:

          .. code-block:: none

              pod init

      #. Open :file:`Podfile` in a text editor and add the pod for core AWS Mobile SDK components to your build.

         .. code-block:: none

              platform :ios, '9.0'
              target :'YOUR-APP-NAME' do
                  use_frameworks!

                  pod 'AWSCore', '~> 2.6.13'

                  # other pods
              end

      #. Install dependencies by running the following:

         .. code-block:: none

             pod install --repo-update

         If you encounter an error message that begins ":code:`[!] Failed to connect to GitHub to update the CocoaPods/Specs . . .`", and your internet connectivity is working, you might need to `update openssl and Ruby <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38993527/cocoapods-failed-to-connect-to-github-to-update-the-cocoapods-specs-specs-repo/48962041#48962041>`__.

      #. The command :code:`pod install` creates a new workspace file. Close your Xcode project and reopen it using :file:`./YOUR-PROJECT-NAME.xcworkspace`.

         .. list-table::
             :widths: 1 6

             * - Use **ONLY** your .xcworkspace

               - Remember to always use :file:`./YOUR-PROJECT-NAME.xcworkspace` to open your Xcode project from now on.

      #. Rebuild your app after reopening it in the workspace to resolve APIs from new libraries called in your code. This is a good practice any time you add import statements.

      Your app is now ready for you to add cloud-powered features. We recommend :ref:`adding analytics <add-aws-mobile-analytics>` as your first feature.
