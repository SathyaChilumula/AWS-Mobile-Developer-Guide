###################################
Add Authentication to the Notes App
###################################

In the :ref:`previous section <tutorial-ios-aws-mobile-notes-analytics>` of this tutorial, we created a mobile backend project using the AWS Amplify CLI, and then added analytics to the sample note-taking app. This section assumes you have completed those steps. If you jumped to this step, please go back and :ref:`start from the beginning <tutorial-ios-aws-mobile-notes-setup>`. In this tutorial, we configure a sign-up / sign-in flow in our mobile backend. We then add a new authentication activity to our note-taking app.

You should be able to complete this section of the tutorial in 15-20 minutes.

Set Up Your Backend
------------------

Before we work on the client-side code, we need to add user sign-in to the backend project.  These steps assume you have already completed the :ref:`analytics <tutorial-ios-aws-mobile-notes-analytics>` portion of this tutorial.

1. In a terminal window, enter the following commands to add user sign-in to the backend project:

   .. code-block:: none

      $ amplify update auth

   When prompted, use the default configuration.

2. Deploy your new resources with the following command:

   .. code-block:: none

      $ amplify push

The :code:`amplify update auth` command updates the existing Amazon Cognito user pool configured for analytics, allowing for username and password authentication with email verification of the sign-up and forgot password flows.  You can adjust this to include multi-factor authentication, TOTP, phone number sign-up and more.

Add Auth Dependencies
---------------------

#. Add the following Auth dependencies in your project's :file:`Podfile`:

   .. code-block:: none

      platform :ios, '9.0'
      target :'MyNotes' do
          use_frameworks!

            # Analytics dependency
            pod 'AWSPinpoint'

            # Auth dependencies
            pod 'AWSUserPoolsSignIn'
            pod 'AWSAuthUI'
            pod 'AWSMobileClient'

          # other pods
      end

   Then, in a terminal run the following:

   .. code-block:: none

      $ pod install


Initialize an AWSMobileClient
-----------------------------

Edit the :file:`AppDelegate.swift` class.  Add the following to the imports:

.. code-block:: swift

   import UIKit

   // Auth imports
   import AWSMobileClient

Add the following function to the :file:`AppDelegate.swift` class:

.. code-block:: swift

   func application(_ application: UIApplication, open url: URL,
           sourceApplication: String?, annotation: Any) -> Bool {

       return AWSMobileClient.sharedInstance().interceptApplication(
          application, open: url,
          sourceApplication: sourceApplication,
          annotation: annotation)
   }

Initialize :code:`AWSMobileClient in the :code:`didFinishLaunching` method of the :file:`AppDelegate.swift` class.

.. code-block:: swift

   func application(
        _ application: UIApplication,
        didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions:
        [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {

        // Other didFinishLaunching code . . .

      /* begin copying code here */
        // Initialize AWSMobileClient
        _ = AWSMobileClient.sharedInstance()
            .interceptApplication(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:launchOptions)
      /* end copying code here */

        return true
   }

Implement Your Sign-in UI
-------------------------

The AWS Mobile SDK provides a library that creates a customizable sign-in UI in your app. To create your sign-in UI, add the following imports and then call the library in the :code:`viewDidLoad()` function of the :file:`MasterViewController.swift`:

.. code-block:: swift

  /* begin copying code here */
   import UIKit
   import AWSAuthCore
   import AWSAuthUI
  /* stop copying code here */

   class MasterViewController: UITableViewController {

        // . . .

        override func viewDidLoad() {
            super.viewDidLoad()
            self.title = "My Notes"

          /* begin copying code here */
            // Get a reference to the analytics service from the AppDelegate
            analyticsService = (UIApplication.shared.delegate as! AppDelegate).analyticsService

            // Get a reference to the data service from the AppDelegate
            dataService = (UIApplication.shared.delegate as! AppDelegate).dataService

            // Instantiate sign-in UI from the SDK library
            if !AWSSignInManager.sharedInstance().isLoggedIn {
                AWSAuthUIViewController.presentViewController(
                    with: self.navigationController!,
                    configuration: nil,
                    completionHandler: { (provider: AWSSignInProvider, error: Error?) in
                        if error != nil {
                            self.analyticsService?.recordEvent("_userauth.auth_fail",
                                parameters: ["message":String(describing:error)], metrics: nil)
                        } else {
                            self.analyticsService?.recordEvent("_userauth.sign_in",
                                parameters: ["userid":AWSIdentityManager.default().identityId!], metrics: nil)
                        }
                    }
                )
            }

          /* end copying code here */

            // Other viewDidLoad() code . . .
        }
    }

The event names used for recording authentication events are specific and drive graphs within the Amazon Pinpoint console.  With these analytics events, you can see authentication failure rates and sign-in rates.

Run the App and Validate Results
--------------------------------

Build and run the project in a simulator. In the sign-in screen, choose :guilabel:`Create new account`.  After you submit the information, you receive a confirmation code via email. Enter the confirmation code to complete registration, and then sign in with your new account.

   * - **Tip**

     - Use Amazon WorkMail as a test email account.

       If you do not want to use your own email account as a test account, create an
       `Amazon WorkMail <https://aws.amazon.com/workmail/>`__ service within AWS for test accounts. You can get started for free with a 30-day trial for up to 25 accounts.
