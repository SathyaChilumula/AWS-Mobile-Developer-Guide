   :description: Learn about |AMH| in more detail.

This following reference content is for existing apps configured using the AWS Mobile Hub console or the AWS Mobile CLI. If you are building a new mobile or web app, or you're adding cloud capabilities to your existing app, use the new `AWS Amplify CLI <http://aws-amplify.github.io/>`__ instead. With the new Amplify CLI, you can use all of the features described in `Announcing the AWS Amplify CLI toolchain <https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/announcing-the-aws-amplify-cli-toolchain/>`__, including AWS CloudFormation functionality that provides additional workflows.
